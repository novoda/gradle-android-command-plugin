Use gradle tasks to run specific `adb` commands.


Description
-----------

You can use this plugin to do things such as:

  - Find all devices attached and get basic info about them
  - Select the first one that complies with a custom rule
  - Install a specific APK from the available build types + flavours
  - Clear preferences or do something related to the APK to prepare for tests
  - Run monkey for that specific APK on that specific device
  - Uninstall the APK

This is particularly useful for CI servers but could be used to speed up development as well.


Adding to your project
----------------------

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.novoda.android-command'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.novoda:gradle-android-command-plugin:1.7.1'
    }
}
```


Simple usage
------------

The plugin creates new tasks that you can use:

  * `installDevice<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.InstallDevice`] - installs the app on a specific device.
  * `uninstallDevice<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.UninstallDevice`] - uninstalls the app from a specific device.
  * `run<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.Run`] - installs and launches the app on a specific device.
  * `start<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.Run`] - launches the app on a specific device (without installing it).
  * `stop<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.Stop`] - Forcibly stops the app on a specific device.
  * `monkey<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.Monkey`] - installs and runs monkey on a specific device.
  * `clearPrefs<Variant>` [`com.novoda.gradle.command.ClearPreferences`] - clears app preferences on a specific device.
  * `com.novoda.gradle.command.Input` - runs `input` scripts, wrapping `adb shell input`.
  * `com.novoda.gradle.command.Files` - enables basic file copy via `push` and `pull`, wrapping the respective adb calls.

For advanced usage please take a look into the sample project [build.gradle](sample/app/build.gradle) file.

Configuration
-------------

### Input Scripting

The plugin provides an extension called `scripts` which allows to perform simple scripting automation.
Here is an example called `autoLogin` which will input the test username and password into the sample app.

```groovy
scripts {
    autoLogin {
        execute {
          2.times {
              text 'bob'
              enter()
          }
          enter()
        }
    }
}
```

This config will create a gradle task called `autoLogin`. Running `./gradlew autoLogin` will try to input `bob` then press `enter`. This will be done 2 times and then another `enter` will be pressed.

You may have a custom groovy closure to do scripting as you like. The following input methods are available:

```
text(String value)
tap(int x, int y)
swipe(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY)
key(int code)
home()
back()
up()
down()
left()
right()
clear()
tab()
enter()
power()
unlock()
```

### Demo Mode

`[enable|disable]DemoMode` tasks are create to control demo mode on Android Marshmallow (API level 23) devices.

By default these tasks setup the demo mode with most common used default values. And they can be controlled with `demoMode` DSL.

```groovy          
demoMode {
    battery {
        level '100'
        plugged 'false'
    }
    network {
        wifi 'show'
        level '4'
    }
    clock.hhmm '0810'
    notifications.visible 'false'
}
``` 

All possible values can be found in [the official Android documentation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/packages/SystemUI/docs/demo_mode.md)

### Install

`installDevice<Variant>` tasks are available by default just to install the app. The plugin also supports an `install` dsl to define custom installation tasks.

**customFlags**

Here is an extension called `fromGooglePlay` which will create `installFromGooglePlay<Variant>` tasks.

```groovy
install {
    fromGooglePlay {
        description "Installs with flag Play Store"
        customFlags {
            ['-i', 'com.android.vending']
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** `customFlags` also supports any custom Closure to be lazily evaluated.

More flags can be found in the `install` section of [the official adb document](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#pm).

**deviceId**

Here is how you can install on a specific device using `deviceId`

```groovy
install {
    toNewestDevice {
        deviceId {
            def device = devices().max { it.sdkVersion() }
            device.id
        }
    }
}
```
